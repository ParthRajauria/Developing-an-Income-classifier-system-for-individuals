# Developing-an-Income-classifier-system-for-individuals
We build a classification model to classify whether an individual income is less than a certain mark or not, based on demographic parameters, and a few financial parameters, in order to predict Subsidy qualification status of an individual. 

## Methods
* We first examine the data and performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset to clean the data and to select the best features to be used for building the model.
* We build a dummy classifier to provide a benchmark accuracy, then we build Logistic Regression and K Nearest Neighbour models on the dataset. We also plot Precision-Recall Curve and ROC curve.

## Future Work to improve model.
* I will implement other Models like RandomForest to get the better accuracy and perform hyperparameter tuning.
* I will implement Neural Network on this dataset to get the best possible accuracy.
* I will work on automating this project and build several ML pipelines so that this system is generalized for other datasets as well.
